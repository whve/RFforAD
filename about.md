# Summary

Effect of AD on 298 traits in MR-Base.

The x-axis shows the standard deviation \(SD\) change or log odds ratio \(OR\) for each of 150 traits per SD decrease in AD. The y-axis shows the p-value for the association on a -log10 scale. The effects on the x-axis correspond to the slope from fixed effects inverse variance weighted \(IVW\) linear regression of single nucleotide polymorphism \(SNP\)-outcome effects regressed on the SNP-LDL effects. When the p-value is  1.30.
